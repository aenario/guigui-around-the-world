#Build the client app

We use in order to build the client app [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) with Bower and Grunt, with AngularJS, Bootstrap and jQuery.

To build the app, install [nodeJs](http://nodejs.org/), then Yeoman

```
npm install -g yo
```

Install the generator for angularJS

```
npm install -g generator-angular
```

More information on [Yeoman's website](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html).
